"""Wait for Vector to hear "Hey Vector!" and then play an animation.

The wake_word event only is dispatched when the SDK program has
not requested behavior control. After the robot hears "Hey Vector!"
and the event is received, you can then request behavior control
and control the robot. See the 'requires_behavior_control' method in
connection.py for more information.
