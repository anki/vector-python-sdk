.. _behavior:

Behavior related classes and functions.

Behaviors represent a complex task which requires Vector's
internal logic to determine how long it will take. This
may include combinations of animation, path planning or
other functionality. Examples include drive_on_charger,
set_lift_height, etc.

For commands such as go_to_pose, drive_on_charger and dock_with_cube,
Vector uses path planning, which refers to the problem of
navigating the robot from point A to B without collisions. Vector
loads known obstacles from his map, creates a path to navigate
around those objects, then starts following the path. If a new obstacle
is found while following the path, a new plan may be created.

The :class:`BehaviorComponent` class in this module contains
functions for all the behaviors.

class ReserveBehaviorControl():
    """A ReserveBehaviorControl object can be used to suppress the ordinary idle behaviors of
    the Robot and keep Vector still between SDK control instances.  Care must be taken when
    blocking background behaviors, as this may make Vector appear non-responsive.

    This class is most easily used via a built-in SDK script, and can be called on the command-line
    via the executable module :class:`anki_vector.reserve_control`:

        .. code-block:: bash

            python3 -m anki_vector.reserve_control

    As long as the script is running, background behaviors will not activate, keeping Vector
    still while other SDK scripts may take control.  Highest-level behaviors like returning to
    the charger due to low battery will still activate.

    System-specific shortcuts calling this executable module can be found in the examples/scripts
    folder.  These scripts can be double-clicked to easily reserve behavior control for the current
    SDK default robot.

    If there is a need to keep background behaviors from activating in a single script, the class
    may be used to reserve behavior control while in scope:

        .. code-block:: python

            import anki_vector
            from anki_vector import behavior

            args = anki_vector.util.parse_command_args()
            with behavior.ReserveBehaviorControl(args.serial):

                # At this point, Vector will remain still, even without
                # a Robot instance being in scope.

                ...

                # take control of the robot as usual
                with anki_vector.Robot() as robot:

                    robot.anim.play_animation("anim_turn_left_01")

                # Robot will not perform idle behaviors until the script completes

                ...

    :param serial: Vector's serial number. The robot's serial number (ex. 00e20100) is located on
                   the underside of Vector, or accessible from Vector's debug screen. Used to
                   identify which Vector configuration to load.
    :param ip: Vector's IP address. (optional)
    :param config: A custom :class:`dict` to override values in Vector's configuration. (optional)
                   Example: :code:`{"cert": "/path/to/file.cert", "name": "Vector-XXXX", "guid": "<secret_key>"}`
                   where :code:`cert` is the certificate to identify Vector, :code:`name` is the
                   name on Vector's face when his backpack is double-clicked on the charger, and
                   :code:`guid` is the authorization token that identifies the SDK user.
                   Note: Never share your authentication credentials with anyone.
